write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

    a method that returns the sum of two integers

      # start
      # print purpose of program
      # get first integer
      #   set first integer to variable1
      # get second integer
      #   set second integer to variable2
      # add variable1 and variable2
      #   set result to result_variable
      # print result_variable
      # end

    a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

      # start
      # print purpose of program
      # get first string
      #   push first string to array
      # get second, third, etc. string or get user input to exit program
      #   push second, third, etc. string to array
      # once exit:
      #   print array by index position with space separators
      # end


    a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

      # start
      # if array index position is odd
      #   next
      # else push to new array
      # return new array
      # end
